# Github Repository Search and view list of issues

Tried out `@ngrx/signals` for the first time and it is a show up project.

Run `npm i` and `ng serve` to view it.

## Use cases:

1. As a User I would like to search GitHub in order to view the available repositories for a given search term

2. As a User I would like to select a particular repository in order to view more details of the selected repository

3. As a user, when viewing a given repository, I should be able to clearly see the URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc

4. As a User I would like to link off to the actual GitHub page where the repository is located in order to view the code in the repository

5. As a User I would like to view a list of all the current issues for a repository in order to view the backlog of issues

6. As a User I would like to filter the list of issues between STATE = ["Open" or "Closed"] in order to look through the filtered list

7. As a User I would like to view a PIE chart that displays the breakdown of issues for the repository (open vs closed) in order to visually see how well built and maintained the repository is
